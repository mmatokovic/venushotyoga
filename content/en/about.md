## Studio

Venus hot yoga studio opened in 2010. We are located in the center of Zagreb in the historical building of Ban Jelačić, which successfully and unharmed survived three major earthquakes, just like yoga is flexible.

Everyone is welcome to our yoga classes and to our [rejuvenation](/rejuvenation "rejuvenation") treatments using natural and non-invasive methods. You can always combine yoga with one of the treatments or with a manual massage.

The mission of Venus hot yoga is to help our students become healthier, more beautiful and happier.

Working on yourself is a journey that we can enjoy, and through physical change, which is definitely possible, comes inner peace and satisfaction.

Classes are held in Croatian and English.

Venus hot yoga is also a place where friendships are made over tea after class, and where you can come for a talk or consultation. Our therapists and instructors Vjerna, Danijel, Ana and Nina are at your service.

She is a Master of Kinesiology with a focus on the basics of kinesiological transformation (change through movement), and is currently enrolled in a doctoral program with a topic of yoga at the Faculty of Kinesiology. She started practicing yoga at the age of 14 as a supplement to her dance training, which she attended at the School of Rhythm and Dance Ana Maletić (graduated with the title of dance pedagogue). In 1992, yoga was also formally taught at the Faculty of Kinesiology. Vjerna has also been teaching the basics of yoga to students at the Faculty of Kinesiology in Zagreb for many years.

Since she was little, she has also been actively involved in martial arts Budokai with her uncle Dr. Emin Topić and competed in kata (3rd place at the World Kata Championship in Venice in 1989).

Vjerna's favorite is "No freedom without discipline" and her new book on yoga has a similar title: Yoga- discipline to freedom. In it, she presents a classification of 196 asanas divided into 18 groups in relation to the position of the upper and lower body on the mat, which allows instructors to easily arrange classes and students to perform them more easily and correctly...
