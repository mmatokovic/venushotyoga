description: HOT YOGA is Hatha yoga that is performed in a room heated to 33 degrees Celsius and about 30% humidity, where the room is ventilated, and the body cools down by sweating so that the feeling is not even close to what it is like when we stand on the whistle and fry on to the sun. On the contrary, it is very pleasant, especially on colder days.

HOT YOGA is an intense training lasting 75 or 90 minutes, where you will increase strength, endurance, flexibility, balance, coordination, and have a good time.

HOT YOGA is Hatha yoga practiced in a room heated to 33 degrees Celsius and about 30% humidity, with the room being ventilated, and the body cools through sweating, so the sensation is nowhere near standing in scorching heat. On the contrary, it is very pleasant, especially on colder days.{{< read-more >}}

* Hatha yoga is a static system of practicing asanas (yoga poses) that encompass the entire body, from the musculoskeletal system to the internal organs and glands down to the cellular level.

* Some classes offer more dynamic styles of yoga that can also be practiced in warmth, but there are always short breaks where practitioners can rest and hydrate. For many, these training conditions sound challenging – let alone practicing on top of that – but once you get used to it, you can count on a range of benefits that make us more focused, stronger, healthier, and – happier.

* If you think practicing in warmth isn't for you, give it 3 to 5 hours, and you'll get used to it. Long-time practitioners even seek additional heaters. During practice, you can lie down and rest anytime, allowing the warmth to relax your body and mind as in a sauna.

## What are the benefits of hot yoga?

The room's temperature aids in stretching, and sweating eliminates toxins. Body detoxification occurs completely naturally. Swelling decreases, and the skin becomes clean and radiant.{{< read-more >}}

* Practicing yoga in warmth is an intense cardio workout; the heart beats faster as more blood reaches the skin, allowing for cooling. According to measurements (Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, May 2014), during a hot yoga session, the heart works approximately as much as during brisk walking at 5.5 km/h.

* In a warm environment, our breathing is deeper, and we expand our lungs to take in more air. This way, we supply the body with more oxygen, making us feel more relaxed and stress-free.

* In warmth, the body quickly reaches its "working temperature," making it much more flexible, and the risk of injury is reduced, of course, if the poses are performed correctly and without pain.

* It helps achieve the ideal body weight and shape the body; on average, 350 to 600 calories are burned in one session, depending on body composition and effort. Yoga also affects centers that regulate appetite, digestion, sleep, and other factors.
