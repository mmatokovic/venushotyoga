## Body and Face Rejuvenation? Sounds Like Science Fiction!

With the help of the Cellu M6 device for the body and the latest Mobylift M6 for the face, such results are indeed possible, and in a short time. The treatments are painless, extremely pleasant and relaxing, and above all, spectacularly successful. It's a non-invasive solution for rejuvenation that turns back time, for those who want to look natural without changing the personality of their face and body.

## How I Discovered Treatments on the LPG Cellu M6 Device and Why I Love Them?

Back in 1996, I went to America and gave birth to my first son in Chicago. I was 24 years old at the time. Soon after, my second son came, and in a total of two years, I gained and lost more than 40 kilograms. You can imagine how my skin on the stomach looked... so I went to a plastic surgeon and wanted to surgically remove it. Luckily, the surgeon suggested treatments on the Lpg Cellu M6 device for skin tightening, and after 20 treatments over about 2 months, it wasn't even noticeable that I had given birth.

Seven years later, in 2003, I moved to Prague where I opened my yoga studio and bought my first LPG device, which was the first LPG in the city at the time. The results on every person were fantastic, whether it was about losing fat in critical areas, water retention in the body, or solving cellulite problems or skin tightening.

In 2007, I returned to Zagreb and opened the Venus Hot Yoga Center. In 2007, my third son was born, and I achieved a record of gaining 30 kilograms during pregnancy!

At that time, I was almost 36 years old, and I was excited about the experiment of losing all those kilos and looking like before pregnancy. I didn't particularly watch what I ate because I was breastfeeding, I practiced yoga lightly, and three times a week I came for treatments on the device. We worked on modeling, fat removal, and skin tightening. It took me about 40 treatments to completely return to my pre-pregnancy state.

And even today, I regularly maintain my body with treatments on the device, firstly because they are extremely pleasant, deeply massage the body, and I also have a complete aesthetic effect. From the age of 35, I started doing face treatments on LPG because they excellently maintain facial tone, solve wrinkles, and irregularities caused by aging and facial expressions, making me look like me just a few years younger.

## Anti-cellulite Treatments for Weight Loss

The Cellu M6 Integral S device successfully solves the problem of cellulite, swelling, loose skin after dieting or childbirth, and it is possible to reduce fat deposits in critical parts of the body such as the waist, thighs, hip pads, knees, or the inner side of the leg. The whole body is reshaped, and we solve problems that we cannot reach with exercise or diet. The treatment lasts for 45 minutes, and the entire body is treated because cellulite can only be solved if the lymphatic system, circulation, and digestion are activated. Special emphasis is placed on critical parts of the body where, for example, in 10 treatments, it is possible to lose up to 10 cm in the waist, 5 cm in the thighs, 8-10 cm in the buttocks, 3 to 5 cm in the knees, and up to 3 cm in the upper arms - these results are achieved in 95% of treated clients. The treatments are also suitable for men who mostly opt for waist size reduction.

The treatment is painless and extremely pleasant and relaxing, and there are no side effects because the device works on the principle of tissue massage and drainage and has the power of 10 human hands, and the method is completely non-invasive. For the best results, it is necessary to come 2 to 3 times a week, and after a series of treatments when we achieve the desired result, maintenance is recommended once or twice a month to make the results more permanent. Often the question is how many treatments are needed? This is very individual and depends on the type and stage of cellulite, whether the person has excess weight, whether there is a problem of water retention, significant weight loss after dieting or childbirth when the skin is sagging, or specific problems that a person has. In people, for example, who retain water in the body, a reduction in volume is visible already after the first treatment, while in people who have a harder build, more treatments are needed to lose centimeters. That's why programs are created individually, and results are guaranteed.

## Facial Rejuvenation

From the renowned French company of health and beauty devices LPG, we received the Mobilift M6 device for facial rejuvenation. The working method called Endermology, tested in 128 scientific studies, is based on the mechanical stimulation of cells, which reactivates their dormant activity and thus promotes self-rejuvenation.

Treatments on the Mobilift M6 LPG device are completely painless, non-invasive, and very pleasant, and they act on all three levels of the skin: epidermis, dermis, and hypodermis, depending on the problem being solved.

As different faces age differently, problems such as loose skin, inflamed cheeks, wrinkles of various depths, facial swelling, eye puffiness and dark circles, double chin and jawline, and thickening in the lower part of the face may occur. Lips can also be successfully enlarged, and wrinkles around the lips and nasolabial folds can be tightened. The treatments promote oxygen flow to the surface of the skin and restore color and firmness to lifeless and grayish skin. The neck, décolleté, and breasts can also be tightened, and the treatment is suitable for both men and women.

Although a significant change is visible after the first treatment, for optimal and more permanent results, about 10 half-hour treatments 2-3 times a week are needed at the beginning.

Tissue stimulation with the help of specially patented heads from LPG (winner of the 2013 Innovation Award) acts on the skin and tissue horizontally and vertically - at different depths of tissue retraction into the massage chamber, and horizontal movement of the wings acts on different problems. The method has been scientifically researched and confirmed at the University Hospital of Besançon in France on 30 subjects, 20 women and 10 men who were treated on one side of the face for 24 treatments, and then tissue samples were taken by biopsy. The treated side showed an 80% increase in hyaluronic acid production, synthesis of elastin which increases skin flexibility, increased by 46%. Massages also eliminate fragmented (destroyed) collagen and then synthesize new collagen, which tightens and firms the skin by 50%. A full facial treatment lasts 30 minutes, and it is also possible to choose a short treatment of 10 minutes for just one critical facial zone or 20 minutes for two zones or for brightness and enhanced oxygen flow to the face.

The principle of treatments on LPG devices is a kind of "lifestyle" just as we regularly exercise, so are facial treatments a workout that keeps the face young and fresh. For the best and most permanent results, 10-30 treatments are needed at the beginning depending on age and the problem. There is no need to take a break between packages; they can be done more frequently (2-3 times a week) or less frequently (2-4 times a month) depending on your preference. Generally, more frequent visits are made until the desired result is achieved, and then maintenance is done with fewer visits. If you want even better results, you can come back at a frequency of 2-3 times a week.

## Hot Stone Massage

Hot stone massage is used to help relax and relieve tense muscles and soft tissues throughout the body.

During the massage, smooth, flat, heated stones are placed on specific parts of the body.

The stones are made of basalt, a type of volcanic rock that retains heat, and are heated to 50 to 55 degrees Celsius.

The massage is extremely pleasant and painless and is excellent for reducing stress, combating insomnia, and boosting immunity. It lasts for 50 minutes and covers the entire body, including the back, legs, and arms.
